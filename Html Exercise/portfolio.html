                <h3> PalStudentsHub Website</h3>
                <p> The purpose of the project is to create a website specifically for Palestinian university 
                    students in an effort to promote interaction amongst students from different majors 
                    who may be geographically apart. The project aims to create a space for students to 
                    share their experiences with one another.</p>
                <p>The website hasn't been built yet, but the importance of creating such a site has been studied, along with the appropriate studies, analysis, and design.</p>

                <h3> Storyboarding to 2d animation movie</h3>
                <p> The idea of this project is to create a short animated movie entitled “The Soul of the Soul”. The idea of the film is to review and recall the memories of a grandfather who lost his granddaughter who was not more than four years old as a result of the Israeli bombing of their house in Gaza during the last aggression in November 2023, where  he described her as the soul of the soul the moment he bid her farewell, hence the  name of the movie was quoted, their memories will be reviewed from the moment he bid her farewell. </p>
